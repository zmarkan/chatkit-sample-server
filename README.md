# Sample server authorization component for Pusher Chatkit

This is the serverside companion to [github.com/zmarkan/chatkit-sample-client](https://github.com/zmarkan/chatkit-sample-client).

It is also designed to be serverless.
The default implementation currently runs on Glitch:  https://glitch.com/~zmarkan-chatkit-sample-server

To set up, follow the [README at the client sample](https://github.com/zmarkan/chatkit-sample-client).
